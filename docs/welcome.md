# About Laramanager

Laramanager is a small admin tool I started in 2016. I wanted an easy solution for adding admin access and admin panel to my Laravel application without installing a full CMS.

Since the days of being a simple admin interface, it has grown with features such as resource and image manager, content builder and RSS feed creator.

Here are a few projects that use Laramanager as their primary admin control system.
